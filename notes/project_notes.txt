Project Notes, October 12, 2019

Goals:
	-polymorphism
	-inheritiance
		-abstract? 
			=> VIEW CADE'S EXAMPLE
	-javaFX (last)

superclass--holes-- => subclasses--bomb//mole

## holes will always do something to points/life/whatever, but
depending on the subclasses--bomb//mole, then it'll do certain
things to the points/life/whatever according to that class ##

QUESTIONS:
	** How to connect Controller.java to Mechanics/Backend.java ? **



October 18, 2019
	Hole => interface
		bombs / mole => classes for implements/inheritiance



	Mechanics:
		- Keeping Track of Players' Score
			- very similar to arcade games
			- needs some .java stuff

		- Mole and Bombs Classes
			- Only choose bombs or mole
			-if choose bomb, points are deducted
			- 50/50 for bomb or mole to pop up in hole
			- Within inheritance tree, add frequency of objects
			- How long they last in the hole

		- Points	
			- 0 points starts off (default)
			- on click bombs deduct 10 points
			- on click mole add 5 points
				- on click on mole in sequence adds extra points
				- on click on special mole adds more points 
			- WILL BE AFFECTED BY FREQUENCY OF BOMB APPEARANCE

		- Game Structure
			- 60 sec max game time (default)
			- future: add levels for variety of time & points

	Views:
		- In-Game View
		- Score Board View
			- or just have a list on the side?
